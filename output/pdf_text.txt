1. Title of the Project – PowerRef  : Application for Recommending  Job Referrals  
 
2. Introduction : 
In the competitive job market, having the right referral can significantly boost a candidate's 
chances of success. However, identifying the most impactful referral is often challenging. 
This app addresses this issue  by recommending the strongest referral based on the user's 
target company and job role. It uses web scraping and a recommendation algorithm to 
analyze and suggest optimal referral opportunities.  
 
In addition to this, the app offers tools like a resume builder, company search, and a 
dashboard for managing and tracking referrals. Unlike general networking platforms, it 
focuses specifically on enhancing job application outcomes through strategic referral s. 
 
3. Problem Definition:  
Job seekers often struggle to identify and leverage the most effective referrals for their job 
applications. Platforms like LinkedIn  and Top mate  provide general networking tools but 
lack specialized features that can prioritize referrals based on relevant criteria such as 
alumni connections, experience, and position within a company. This concern  reduces a 
candidate’s chances of standing out to recruiters and gaining an advantage in the hiring 
process.  Additionally, these existing platforms do not offer integrated tools like a resume 
builder , which forces users to rely on external solutions, adding unnecessary complexity 
to their job search process . These platforms limit users' ability to fully optimize their job 
applications and making the process less efficient by  not offering prioritized referral sug-
gestions and a built -in resume -building feature . 
 
So, this project aims to develop an application that guides user to  choose  the strongest 
referral based on their target company and position  by using recommendation algorithm .

4. Objectives  
1.  Facilitate Resume Building:  It provides a resume builder to help users to create 
and customize their resumes for different job opportunities.  
 
2.  Referrals  recommendation : It provide s users a list of individuals who can provide 
referral, according to their target company and job role.  
 
3.  Improve Success Rates:  It uses recommendation algorithm  to find suitable persons 
to take referral from , increas ing the chances of job application success.  
 
4. Interview Preparation:  It includes a quiz or MCQ -based module to help users pre-
pare for job interviews by testing their knowledge on common interview topics.

7. Description  
• Technology Stack  
1.  Frontend:  using Kotlin  and XML  to create a smooth and user -friendly 
interface.  
2.  Backend:  The backend is built with Node.js  to handle communication 
between the app and server . MongoDB  is used as the database to store all 
the data.  
 
• Architecture:   
MVC (Model -View -Controller)  architecture  is used to develop this app.  
In this setup:  
• Model:  Manages the data  and business logic.  
• View:  Handles the UI, displaying information to the user and ensuring a  
good user experience.  Start Date of Project Phase -I:  20, Jan’25  
End Date of Project Phase -I:  30, April ’25  
Total No. of Weeks:  15

 • Controller:  Acts as the intermediary, processing user inputs, making API 
calls, and updating the Model and View accordingly.  
 
• Data  Parsing and Recommendation Engine:  
The backend performs data parsing  by extracting information from multiple  
websites such as Peerlist . This data is then processed to build profiles of poten-
tial job referees.  
The recommendation engine  is the core feature of the app, employing algo-
rithms that consider multiple parameters, including:  
• Alumni connections : Recommends referees who share educational 
backgrounds with the user.  
• Professional experience : Weighs in the years of experience and exper-
tise of potential referees.  
• Position in the company : Prioritizes referees holding senior or relevant 
positions.  
• Skills match : Suggests referees based on overlapping skillsets with the 
user's profile.  
• Resume Building Feature:   
Allows users to create professional resumes directly within the application. Users 
can input their details, select templates, and auto -populate fields based on existing 
data in their profile.

12. Expected Challenges -  
• User Adoption and Engagement:  Ensuring that users adopt the platform and remain 
actively engaged can be challenging. The platform must offer clear value and an good 
user experience to attract and retain users.  
• Integration Complexity:  Integrating various components such as frontend interfaces, 
backend APIs, and third -party services  may present technical challenges, requiring 
careful coordination and testing.  
• Security and Data Privacy:  Safeguarding sensitive user information is critical. 
Implementing and maintaining high -security standards and compliance with data 
protection regulations will be a significant challenge.  
• Scalability Issues:  As the platform grows, it must handle increasing data and user 
interactions efficiently.
